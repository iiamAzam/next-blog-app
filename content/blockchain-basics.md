## What is Blockchain?

Blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger that records transactions across many computers in such a way that the registered transactions cannot be altered retroactively. It ensures transparency, security, and immutability of data.

### Key Features of Blockchain

- **Decentralization:** No central authority controls the blockchain.
- **Transparency:** All participants can view the transactions.
- **Security:** Cryptographic hashing ensures data integrity.
- **Immutability:** Once data is added, it cannot be changed.

## How Blockchain Works

Blockchain works by using a network of computers (nodes) to validate and record transactions in a secure and immutable manner.

### Steps in Blockchain Process:

1. A transaction is initiated.
2. The transaction is broadcast to a peer-to-peer network of nodes.
3. The nodes validate the transaction using consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS).
4. Once verified, the transaction is added to a new block.
5. The new block is chained to the previous block, forming a blockchain.

### Example of a Simple Blockchain in Python

```python
import hashlib
import json

class Blockchain:
    def __init__(self):
        self.chain = []
        self.create_block(proof=1, previous_hash='0')

    def create_block(self, proof, previous_hash):
        block = {
            'index': len(self.chain) + 1,
            'proof': proof,
            'previous_hash': previous_hash,
        }
        self.chain.append(block)
        return block

    def get_previous_block(self):
        return self.chain[-1]

    def hash(self, block):
        encoded_block = json.dumps(block, sort_keys=True).encode()
        return hashlib.sha256(encoded_block).hexdigest()

blockchain = Blockchain()
print(blockchain.chain)
```
